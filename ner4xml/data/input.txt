				OBSERVATIONS
			
				1909
			
				Begun September 1, 1909
			
				September 1 - Observed Occultation of
				Mars by Moon’s bright limb at
				8h 58m occultation took 40s.
				Ending at 9:57 was not observed.
				Shy hazy. Moon fair. Observed Mare Humorum Cleomedes Langrenus
			
				Septr. 2 - Observed Mars at 9h. Markings
				faint & ill defined. Also observed Moon
				Mare Humorum appears similar to a
				section “bitten” out of the moon’s
				terminator.
			
				1910
			
				Thursday, May 26 Observed Halley’s
				Comet 8.45-9.30 p.m.
				Visible in west. Head about
				1.5mag. (slightly less brilliant
				than Regulus). Tail broad
			
				May 26, 1910, Continued
			
				& well defined. Quite bright
				for about 15°, distinctly
				traceable about 30° (to a
				point above crater).
				Head about 9h 30m R.A.
				3° decl. on border of Hydra
				& Sextans. Nucleus & Coma
				well defined. Used B&S
				prism binoculars, power 8.
			
				Regulus
				Hydra
				Position at 9 p.m.
				Observed. from Providence-Taunton Pike
				at a point just northeast from Nichol’s
				Crossing. Looking westward

				1912
			
				February 1st. Observed a lunar halo
				at about 6:30 p.m. Moon 1day of full
				Halo was of about 45° diameter,
				with rather noticeable paraselenae
				on an horizontal line with the
				moon. No prismatic colours
				were apparent. The left hand
				(northern) paraselena was
				more or less obscured by clouds
				and appeared only at intervals.
				The right-hand mock-moon
				was prominent, and attracted
				much attention. The two
				paraselenae were seen as
			
				February 1, 1912, Continued
			
				diffused patches of light.
			
				This part of halo most prominent.
				North
				Paraselena
				(faint & visible
				only at intervals)
				Moon
				South
				Paraselena
				(Prominent -
				attracted much attention)
				Clouds
				EASTERN HORIZON
			
				The northern arc of the halo
				was by far the brightest part.
			
				October 19, 11:00p.m. Observed Moon, 2days gibbous.
				Copernicus on terminator.
				Tycho, Clavius & Maginus were
				favourably situate in the
				southern part of the disc.
			
				1913
			
				No observations
			
				1914
			
				In January, Mars & Saturn were
				observed.
			
				February 26, 6:h 15m p.m. Observed Moon, 2days old,
				and Mercury.
				Moon's crescent very thin. Earthshine
				visible even in strong twilight.
				Mercury appeared about 5° below and to
				the right of Moon, twinkling like a
				bright star in the increasing
				dusk.
				☽︎ R.A. 23h 56m Dec +1°
				☿ R.A. 23h 35m Dec -0° 3'
				The above position very rough.
			
				February 26, 1914, Continued
			
				The Moon was almost at the
				Vernal Equinox.
			
				Mercury
				View looking northwest
				Earlier in the day the Moon
				and Mercury had been in
				conjunction.
			
				March 11-12 Observed partial
				eclipse of Moon. Over 0.9 of disc
				eclipsed. Very well seen.
			
				September 16 - 4 a.m. to dawn -
				Observed Delavan’s Comet
				&heavens in general.
				Delavan’s Comet lay in R.A.
				10h 08m 06s., Dec. 49° 51' 14"
				in Ursa Major, as shown by diagram.
			
				Plough
				Comet
				Northeast Horizon
			
				It had about the brightness of a
				star of the 4th. magnitude,
				appearing to the naked eye, as a
				blurred spot of light; rather faint,
				yet easily visible. In the opera
				glasses this blur resolved itself
			
				into a star-like nucleus, a bright
				coma, & a short, broad tail. In the
				prism binoculars these details were
				better seen, whilst in the 3" telescope
				with powers of 50 & 100 the comet
				was indeed a beautiful sight.
				A small telescope star could
				at that time be seen shining through
				the faint luminosity of the tail.
				The best view was with 3" telescope
				terrestrial Eyepiece 50 diameters.
			
				Tail about 1° in length.
				Observations made from grounds of
				residence, & somewhat hampered
				by electric street lights.
			
				At this same time Moon was a
				beautiful crescent 3days before new.
				Earthshine very powerful: Could see
				Maria Crisium, Serenitatis Tranquillitatis
				Fecunditatis Nectaris very plainly on dark
				part of disc.
				Schickard on terminator - fine
				sight. Grimaldi visible - very dark.
				Saturn also fine object.
				Winter stars fully in view - Orion,
				Canis Major, +c. Orion's nebula
				very beautiful in 3" with power 50
			
				September 17 - Observed Delavan’s Comet
				4-5 a.m. Also Moon.
				Earthshine on Moon very strong,
				especially when rising above house top
				& bright thin crescent hidden.
				Comet appears brighter as Moon wanes.
			
				Principal Astronomical Work
			
				(1) To keep track of all celestial
				phenomena month by month, as
				positions of planets, phases of moon,
				Sign of Sun, Occultations, Meteor Showers,
				unusual phenomena (record)
				also new discoveries.
			
				(2) To keep up a working knowledge
				of the constellations and their
				Seasons.
			
				(3) To observe all planets, etc.
				with a large telescope when they
				are favourably situated (at 7h 30m
				in winter, about 9h or less in Summer,
				supplemented by morning observations)
			
				(4) To observe opera or field glass
				objects among the stars with a low
				power instrument, recording results,
			
				(5) To keep a careful record of
				each night’s work.
			
				(6) To contribute a monthly
				astronomical article of about 7 p. M.S.
				or 4 p. type, to the Providence Evening
				News. (Began Jan 1, 1914.)
